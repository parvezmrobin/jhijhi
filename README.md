*A simple react app backed by Express JS to maintain cricket score*

## Live

> You can use the app from https://jhijhi.netlify.com.

## Installation
To install the app in your local machine
make sure you have `node` and `yarn` installed. Then run
```bash
yarn install
```

After installation completes, copy `.env.example` to `.env`. 
Make sure the backend is running.
Finally, run 
```bash
yarn run dev
```

Wait a while. **Bingo!** The app's running in your browser.

If you don't have an account (you surely won't have in the first run), 
make one from the [Register](http://localhost:3000/register) page. 
Login and explore.

Thank me later. Find some bug first.
